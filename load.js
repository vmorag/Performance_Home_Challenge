// === Load Testing ===
// https://k6.io/docs/test-types/load-testing/

//? Definition: used to determine a system's behavior under both normal and peak conditions.
//? Why is it important?
// * Assess the current performance of your system under typical and peak load.
// * Make sure you continue to meet the performance standards as you make changes to your system (code and infrastructure).

//API for testing: https://test-api.k6.io/auth/token/login/

import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep} from 'k6';

export const options = {
  // Let's simulating a normal day
  // to resemble your normal and peak conditions more closely.
  // In that case you could configure the load test to stay at 60(will use 6 for the demo) users 
  // for most of the day, and ramp-up to 100 users during the peak hours of operation,
  // then ramp-down back to normal load

  stages: [
    { duration: '1m', target: 6 },
    { duration: '1m', target: 6}, 
    { duration: '1m', target: 10}, 
    { duration: '1m', target: 10}, 
    { duration: '1m', target: 6}, 
    { duration: '1m', target: 6}, 
    { duration: '1m', target: 0 }, 
  ],

  //Why rump-up stages are important?
  /*  It lets your system warm up or auto scale to handle the traffic.
      It lets you compare the response time between the low-load and nominal-load stages.
      *If you run a load test using our SaaS cloud service, it allows the automated performance alerts to better understand the normal behaviour of your system.
   *

  //Threshold documentation: https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/thresholds/
  // * Thresholds are the pass/fail criteria that you define for your test metrics. 
  // * If the performance of the system under test (SUT) does not meet the conditions of your threshold, the test will finish with a failed status.
  // * If your smoke test produces any errors, you should either correct the script or fix your environment before you continue.
  thresholds: {
    'http_req_duration': ['p(99)<1500'], // 99% of requests must complete below 1.5s
  },
