// === Stress - Load Testing ===
// https://k6.io/docs/test-types/stress-testing/

//? Definition: the purpose of stress testing is to assess the availability and stability of the system under heavy load. 
//? ------ >    It is a type of load testing used to determine the limits of the system. The purpose of this test is to verify the stability and reliability of the system under extreme conditions.
//? Why is it important? To determine
// * How your system behaves under extreme conditions.
// * What the maximum capacity of your system is in terms of users or throughput.
// * What is the breaking point of your system and its failure mode.
// * Whether your system will recover without manual intervention after the stress test is over.

//! Note that a stress test doesn't overwhelm the system immediatelyâ€”that's a spike test, which is covered in the next section.
// Classic examples of a need for stress testing are Black Friday or Cyber Monday, two days each year that generate multiple times the normal traffic for many websites.

//! NO PROD, We recommend running a stress test in a UAT or staging environment.
